This repository has an actual working directshow audio input source filter (source is in "acam", solution is "virtual audio output replay.sln".
It just plays static.

Simplified examples like this were pretty hard to find online, and not even the MSDN SDK examples seemed to have any audio source examples.

UPDATE a more "full" example can also be found in my slightly more developed https://github.com/rdp/virtual-audio-capture-grabber-device

This one works as an audio input source, in VLC, and in graphedit, etc.

I took out all the threading constructs so that you can more easily tell what is going on.

It advertises and streams a single, 44100 khz "white noise" (well, randomly generated signal).

To see the code, open "virtual audio output replay.sln"

to develop, you'll want to build it then run
regsvr32 acam.ax (as administrator)

For further exploration, I would recommend the directshow samples "synth" project which shows you how to setup a dynamic source, and is more complex.
"synth" doesn't show up as an inputs device by default, but you could combine it with this project to have it do so.



Enjoy.
